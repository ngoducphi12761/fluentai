Geometry Overview:
The Geometry uses a static mixer with the following key boundaries:

velocity-inlet-1: Main inlet with high-speed flow to drive mixing.

velocity-inlet-2: Secondary inlet with lower-speed, warmer fluid for thermal mixing.

wall: Solid boundary confining the flow, used for heat and shear analysis.

pressure-outlet: Outlet for mixed fluid, set to a fixed pressure.

This setup models the mixing of two streams in a confined domain.
