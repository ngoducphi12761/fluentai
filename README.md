# FluentAI – Autonomous CFD Simulation Assistant Powered by RAG + LLMs & Rule-Based Reasoning

> Created by **Duc Phi Ngo (Mr. Bill)** — an experienced CFD/FEA engineer and AI/ML software developer, dedicated to bridging physics-based simulation with intelligent automation.

## Project Vision
**FluentAI** integrates multiple technologies across AI/NLP, simulation automation, and software engineering domains to deliver an intelligent, voice-driven CFD assistant.
**FluentAI** is an intelligent assistant that transforms how engineers interact with simulation tools like **Ansys Fluent**, **STAR-CCM+**, and **OpenFOAM**. It replaces GUI-driven workflows with **natural language commands**, powered by a fusion of:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for domain-aware memory
- **LLM-driven reasoning (LLaMA 3 / GPT)** for understanding engineering tasks
- **Rule-based action planning** for deterministic control and safe automation

The result is a **decision-making AI agent** capable of understanding, planning, and executing full CFD simulation pipelines — just from human voice or text.

## Why It Matters

In modern engineering environments, simulation experts waste significant time on:
- Manual GUI operations across platforms
- Repetitive setup and post-processing steps
- Poor integration between engineering logic and AI tools

**FluentAI eliminates these bottlenecks** by acting as a fully programmable AI operator — capable of interpreting instructions, retrieving domain-specific context, and generating structured action plans for automated simulation execution.

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Multi-Modal Input
- Voice or text commands interpreted via Whisper/GTTS
- Multi-intent recognition: questions, knowledge queries, or executable instructions

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- FAISS/Chroma-based vector search over local engineering documents (YAMLs, PDFs, Fluent configs)
- LangChain-powered retrieval from domain-specific sources

### AI & Natural Language Processing
- **LLaMA 3** – Large Language Models for command understanding and reasoning
- **Prompt Engineering + Rule-Based Parsing** – Interprets commands using deterministic and semantic rules
- Uses enhanced prompts to:
  - Extract structured commands from unstructured queries
  - Apply **condition-action rules** for accurate interpretation
  - Output **structured JSON action plans** to control Fluent simulation pipelines

### Deterministic Simulation Control
- Action plans executed via PyFluent: meshing, boundary conditions, solver config, post-processing
- Only support Steady flow for:
  - Inlet velocity/temperature
  - Turbulence model setup
  - Solver iteration control
  - Contour and plane slicing for visualization
  - number of Iterations 

### CFD Automation
  - Ansys PyFluent – Python API access for geometry import, meshing, solver setup, and post-processing
  - Structured **input.yaml** – Declarative config for repeatable simulations
  - JSON Action Plans – Machine-readable plans generated by the LLM for each user command
### Software Engineering Stack
- Python 3.10+ – Core development language
- Modular Architecture – Isolated layers for NLP, retrieval, simulation control, and voice interface
- Custom Action Dispatcher – Executes Fluent automation based on structured reasoning
- CLI + Voice Loop – Dual-mode operation for demo and production use
