# Boundary Conditions in CFD (focused on Velocity Inlets)

A "velocity inlet" is a type of boundary condition where the velocity magnitude or vector of the incoming fluid is specified. 
It is typically used when the velocity of the fluid entering the domain is known. 
Velocity inlets can be defined for compressible or incompressible flows.

The user must specify:
- Magnitude of the velocity (in m/s, ft/s, etc.)
- Direction of flow (vector or normal to surface)
- Turbulence parameters (optional): intensity and length scale or viscosity ratio.

Common usage:
- Inlets for fans, jets, intakes.
- Simulation setups where flow rate control is required.

Key Notes:
- If multiple inlets exist, the same velocity can be assigned to all, or customized per inlet.
- Typical simulation boundary names include "inlet-1", "inlet-2", etc.
- Units must be consistent (e.g., SI: m/s).
